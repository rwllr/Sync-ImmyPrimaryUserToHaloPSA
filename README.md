# Sync-ImmyPrimaryUserToHaloPSA

# Usage
Make sure your Immy is synced to Automate customers, and Halo is synced to Automate sites otherwise we cannot match a Immy tenant to a Halo customer.
This can be refactored to no longer need that once Immy implements the HaloPSA integration. Please bug @DarrenDK about this and tell him I sent you.
